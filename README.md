# sqm-scripts-nss: Hardware-Accelerated SQM for Qualcomm NSS (IPQ60xx/IPQ807x)

> Eliminate bufferbloat on OpenWrt with **zero CPU overhead** using Qualcomm NSS hardware offload. Achieve A+ bufferbloat grades at 300+ Mbps while your router's CPU stays idle.

This is a fork of [qosmio/sqm-scripts-nss](https://github.com/qosmio/sqm-scripts-nss) with a flattened qdisc hierarchy, automatic overhead detection, tighter queue limits, and dead code removal. The implementation is validated on IPQ807x (Qualcomm IPQ8074) with kernel 6.12, PPPoE, VLAN 7, and 300 Mbps FTTH, and supports IPQ60xx (including IPQ6010/IPQ6018) when the firmware exposes the required NSS qdisc capabilities.

**Maintainer:** Julius Bairaktaris — [julius@bairaktaris.de](mailto:julius@bairaktaris.de)

## Why NSS SQM?

Standard SQM (fq_codel, CAKE) runs on the router's CPU. On Qualcomm IPQ60xx/IPQ807x platforms, the **NSS (Network Subsystem)** co-processor handles packet scheduling in dedicated hardware, freeing the CPU entirely. This means:

- **No CPU load** from traffic shaping, even at gigabit speeds
- **Consistent latency** regardless of what else the router is doing (WiFi, NAT, firewall)
- **A+ bufferbloat grades** on [Waveform](https://www.waveform.com/tools/bufferbloat) with zero added latency under download load

The tradeoff: NSS only supports `nssfq_codel` (no CAKE, no HFSC, no multi-class traffic classification). But for most users, a well-tuned fq_codel with hardware offload outperforms a feature-rich software qdisc that competes with the CPU for resources.

## What This Fork Changes

The upstream script creates a deep 7-qdisc hierarchy per direction with priority bands that **never receive any traffic** (verified with real packet counters). This fork strips it down to the minimum effective configuration: 2 qdiscs per direction, auto-detected overhead, and tighter queue limits.

See [Fork Changes](#fork-changes-v20260215) for the full technical breakdown with before/after measurements.

## Requirements

- OpenWrt with NSS support (IPQ60xx, including IPQ6010/IPQ6018, or IPQ807x platform)
- `sqm-scripts` package
- `kmod-qca-nss-drv-qdisc` and `kmod-qca-nss-drv-igs` kernel modules
- `luci-app-sqm` (optional, for GUI configuration)

## Installation

### Quick Install (scp)

Copy the script directly to your router:

```bash
scp nss-zk.qos root@192.168.1.1:/usr/lib/sqm/nss-zk.qos
```

### OpenWrt Build System

Add to your feeds and build:

```bash
echo "src-git sqm_scripts_nss https://github.com/JuliusBairaktaris/sqm-scripts-nss.git" >> feeds.conf
./scripts/feeds update && ./scripts/feeds install sqm-scripts-nss
```

Then select `sqm-scripts-nss` in menuconfig under Network.

## Configuration

1. Go to **Network -> SQM QoS** in LuCI
2. Set your **WAN interface** (e.g. `wan`)
3. Set **download/upload speeds** to ~95% of your actual line speed
4. Under **Queue Discipline**, select `fq_codel` and `nss-zk.qos`
5. Click **Save & Apply**

That's it for basic setup. The script auto-detects your overhead based on your connection type.

### Verifying It Works

```bash
tc -s qdisc show dev wan
tc -s qdisc show dev ifb@wan
```

You should see exactly **2 qdiscs per direction** (nsstbl + nssfq_codel), both with `accel_mode 0` (NSS offload active):

```
qdisc nsstbl 1: root refcnt 5 rate 145Mbit mtu 1536b accel_mode 0
 Sent 4316052 bytes 6563 pkt (dropped 0, overlimits 182 requeues 0)
qdisc nssfq_codel 10: parent 1: target 4ms limit 354p interval 50ms
 flows 1024 quantum 304 set_default accel_mode 0
 Sent 4316052 bytes 6563 pkt (dropped 0, overlimits 0 requeues 0)
 maxpacket 1518 drop_overlimit 0 new_flow_count 2258 ecn_mark 0
```

If you see `nssprio`, `nsspfifo`, or `nssred` in the output, the old upstream script is still loaded.

The script logs the detected device-tree platform for diagnostics, but does not use the SoC name to guess shaping parameters. Check it with:

```bash
logread | grep 'NSS platform'
```

Unknown platform names are allowed when the required NSS modules and qdisc commands work; firmware capability is the compatibility check.

### Overhead (Auto-Detected)

When `OVERHEAD` is not set in the SQM config, the script **automatically detects** the correct value by reading your network interface configuration:

| Component | Bytes | How detected |
|---|---|---|
| Ethernet (header + FCS) | 18 | Always present |
| NSS internal framing | 4 | Always present |
| PPPoE (header + PPP) | +10 | `network.<iface>.proto = pppoe` |
| DS-Lite (IPv6 encap) | +40 | `network.<iface>.proto = dslite` |
| MAP-E (IPv4-in-IPv6) | +20 | `network.<iface>.proto = map` |
| VLAN 802.1Q tag | +4 | `network.<iface>.device` contains `.` |

Auto-detected values per connection type:

| Connection Type | Overhead |
|---|---|
| Ethernet (direct) | 22 |
| PPPoE | 32 |
| PPPoE + VLAN (e.g. Telekom DE) | 36 |
| DS-Lite (IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel) | 62 |
| MAP-E (IPv4-in-IPv6 mapping) | 42 |

Check what was detected:

```bash
logread | grep auto_detect_overhead
# SQM: auto_detect_overhead: proto=pppoe device=wan.7 -> overhead=36 bytes
```

Setting any non-zero `OVERHEAD` value in LuCI overrides auto-detection.

### Gaming-Optimized Tuning

For low-latency gaming, set these under **Advanced Options** in LuCI:

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Target (egress + ingress) | `4ms` | Aggressive CoDel — detects bloat faster |
| Advanced option string | `interval 50ms quantum 304` | 50ms reaction time, 5x priority for small packets (<304 bytes like game/VoIP packets) |

The script auto-calculates queue limits based on a 30ms window. Don't set manual limits unless you know what you're doing.

### Example: Telekom Germany FTTH (300/150 Mbps)

Deutsche Telekom uses PPPoE over VLAN 7. Minimal SQM config — overhead is auto-detected:

```
Interface:  wan
Download:   285000 kbps  (300 * 0.95)
Upload:     142500 kbps  (150 * 0.95)
Script:     nss-zk.qos
Qdisc:      fq_codel
Overhead:   (leave empty — auto-detects 36)

Advanced options:  interval 50ms quantum 304
Target:            4ms
```

## Fork Changes (v20260215)

### Before: Upstream v20240502

The upstream script creates **7 qdiscs per direction** (14 total). Real packet counters from an IPQ807x router running 140/285 Mbps:

```
=== EGRESS (wan) — 7 qdiscs ===
nsstbl 1: root           rate 140Mbit    219,785 pkt
nssprio 10: parent 1:    bands 3         219,785 pkt
nsstbl 100: parent 10:1  rate 14Mbit           0 pkt  (dead)
nsspfifo 1000:                                 0 pkt  (dead)
nsstbl 200: parent 10:2  rate 56Mbit           0 pkt  (dead)
nssred 2000:                                   0 pkt  (dead)
nssfq_codel 300: parent 10:3 set_default 220,011 pkt  (all traffic)

=== INGRESS (ifb@wan) — 7 qdiscs ===
nsstbl 1: root           rate 285Mbit    829,512 pkt
nssprio 10: parent 1:    bands 3         829,512 pkt
nsstbl 100: parent 10:1  rate 28.5Mbit         0 pkt  (dead)
nsspfifo 1000:                                 0 pkt  (dead)
nsstbl 200: parent 10:2  rate 114Mbit          0 pkt  (dead)
nssred 2000:                                   0 pkt  (dead)
nssfq_codel 300: parent 10:3 set_default 829,569 pkt  (all traffic)
```

10 out of 14 qdiscs process **zero packets**. The `nssprio` DSCP classification is ineffective because NSS ECM (Enhanced Connection Manager) accelerates flows after the first packet, bypassing Linux TC filters entirely.

### After: Fork v20260215

**2 qdiscs per direction** (4 total):

```
=== EGRESS (wan) — 2 qdiscs ===
nsstbl 1: root              rate 145Mbit  mtu 1536b  accel_mode 0
nssfq_codel 10: parent 1:   target 4ms  limit 354p  interval 50ms  quantum 304

=== INGRESS (ifb@wan) — 2 qdiscs ===
nsstbl 1: root              rate 295Mbit  mtu 1536b  accel_mode 0
nssfq_codel 10: parent 1:   target 4ms  limit 720p  interval 50ms  quantum 304
```

### Bufferbloat Test Results (Waveform)

Both upstream and fork achieve **A+** grades. Latency is identical — the fork just removes dead weight:

| Metric | Upstream | Fork |
|---|---|---|
| **Bufferbloat grade** | A+ | A+ |
| Unloaded latency | 11 ms | 11 ms |
| Download +latency | +0 ms | +0 ms |
| Upload +latency | +5 ms | +5 ms |
| Download speed | 249 Mbps | 267 Mbps |
| Upload speed | 121 Mbps | 125 Mbps |
| Qdiscs (per direction) | 7 | 2 |
| Queue limit | 3000p (manual) | 354-720p (auto) |

### Technical Changes

#### 1. Flattened qdisc hierarchy

Removed the `nssprio` subtree (nssprio, 2x nsstbl, nsspfifo, nssred) — 5 dead qdiscs per direction. `nssfq_codel` is now a direct child of the root `nsstbl`.

The old hierarchy existed for DSCP-based priority classification, but it never worked: `set_default` routed all traffic to band 2, and no TC filters were configured. Even if filters existed, NSS ECM accelerates flows after the first packet — only the initial SYN ever hits TC classification.

#### 2. Tighter queue limits

`MAXQLIMIT_MS` reduced from 100ms to 30ms. Queue depth is auto-calculated based on speed and MTU:

- 300 Mbps → ~720 packets (30ms)
- 150 Mbps → ~354 packets (30ms)
- Below ~130 Mbps → 200 packets (MINLIMIT floor, sufficient for CoDel)

The old 100ms default allowed initial bufferbloat before CoDel's detection kicked in.

#### 3. Automatic overhead detection

New `auto_detect_overhead()` function reads UCI network config to determine L2 framing overhead. Detects PPPoE (+10 bytes) and VLAN tagging (+4 bytes) automatically. Falls back to 22 bytes (Ethernet + NSS) for plain ethernet connections.

The upstream script hardcoded 18 bytes when overhead wasn't configured — wrong for PPPoE (needs 32-36) and gave no indication that configuration was needed.

#### 4. ECN passthrough (firmware limitation documented)

ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) allows CoDel to **mark** packets instead of **dropping** them during congestion. The sender sees the CE (Congestion Experienced) mark and slows down — same effect as a drop, but no retransmissions needed. This is especially useful for ingress shaping where drops trigger expensive TCP retransmits.

**Source code analysis** — ECN appears fully wired from tc → kernel → firmware:

| Layer | Source | ECN support |
|---|---|---|
| Firmware interface | [`nss_shaper.h`](https://git.codelinaro.org/clo/qsdk/oss/lklm/nss-drv/-/blob/NHSS.QSDK.12.5.0.6/exports/nss_shaper.h) | `uint32_t ecn` field in `nss_shaper_config_codel_param` |
| Kernel module | [`nss_codel.c`](https://git.codelinaro.org/clo/qsdk/oss/lklm/nss-clients/-/blob/NHSS.QSDK.12.5.0.6/nss_qdisc/nss_codel.c) | `q->ecn = qopt->ecn` — wires tc parameter through to firmware |
| tc userspace | `q_nss.c` (iproute2 patch) | `ecn`/`noecn` keywords parsed, `opt.ecn` set |
| tc stats output | `q_nss.c` | `ecn_mark %u` counter printed in `tc -s` |

**However, testing confirms the NSS firmware does NOT actually perform ECN marking:**

| Test condition | Result |
|---|---|
| ECN negotiated end-to-end | Yes — `ss -teni` shows `ecn ecnseen` on all TCP flows |
| iperf3 `-4 -R -P 4` sustained 265 Mbps, 15 sec | ~1200 CoDel drops (`drop_overlimit`) |
| `ecn_mark` counter after test | **0** (never incremented) |
| Firmware / kernel | NHSS.QSDK.12.5, kernel 6.12.68 |
| Test date | February 2026 |

The firmware accepts the `ecn` parameter and exposes the `ecn_mark` counter, but the CoDel implementation always drops rather than marks. The counter is dead code in the current firmware.

The script still forwards SQM's ECN settings (`EECN`/`IECN` from `defaults.sh`) to `nssfq_codel` for forward-compatibility — if Qualcomm fixes the firmware, ECN marking will start working without script changes. If the tc binary rejects the parameter (stock iproute2 without the [ECN patch](https://github.com/qosmio/openwrt-ipq/pull/86)), the script retries without it and logs a warning.

#### 5. Code cleanup

- Added ECN passthrough with graceful fallback (forwards SQM ECN settings; retries without if tc rejects)
- Removed `cake_egress()` / `cake_ingress()` stubs (CAKE not supported by NSS)
- Extracted `calc_effective_mtu()` to DRY up duplicated overhead+MTU logic in `egress()`/`ingress()`
- Replaced bash-only `[[ ]]` tests with POSIX `case` patterns (shebang is `#!/bin/sh`)
- Simplified `sqm_stop()` for flat hierarchy (single `tc qdisc del root` instead of nested teardown)
- Added `ipt_log_rewind` in `sqm_stop()` for proper iptables rule cleanup
- Fixed `exit $?` → `return $?` in `sqm_start()` (no longer kills the shell on `check_addr` failure)
- Fixed inconsistent raw `tc` vs `$TC` wrapper usage in `sqm_stop()`
- Proper `local` scoping for all function variables (`burst`, `quantum`, `mtu`, etc.)
- Removed unused ECN parameter from `add_nsstbl()`
- Fixed `local IFACE` vs `IF` variable name mismatch

## FAQ

### Does this work with CAKE?

No. NSS hardware only supports `nssfq_codel`. CAKE, HFSC, and HTB are software-only qdiscs that run on the CPU. If you need CAKE features (per-host fairness, tin-based prioritization), use the standard `piece_of_cake.qos` script — but expect CPU usage.

### What routers are supported?

Any OpenWrt router with a **Qualcomm IPQ60xx (including IPQ6010/IPQ6018) or IPQ807x / IPQ8074** SoC and NSS-enabled firmware. The NSS co-processor must be active with `kmod-qca-nss-drv-qdisc` and `kmod-qca-nss-drv-igs` loaded, and the firmware's `tc` must support `nsstbl`, `nssfq_codel`, and `nssmirred`. SoC identification is diagnostic only; unsupported firmware will fail during qdisc setup and be rolled back.

### How is this different from qosmate?

[qosmate](https://github.com/hudra0/qosmate) is a CPU-based QoS system using HFSC/HTB + nftables for DSCP classification. It offers multi-class traffic prioritization but cannot offload to NSS. This script trades classification features for **zero CPU overhead** via hardware offload — better for high-throughput links where CPU is the bottleneck.

### Do I need to set overhead manually?

No. The script auto-detects PPPoE (+10 bytes) and VLAN (+4 bytes) overhead from your UCI network config. You only need to set it manually if auto-detection gets it wrong (check with `logread | grep auto_detect_overhead`).

### Why is my bufferbloat grade A instead of A+?

A vs A+ is within Waveform's test-to-test variance (~1ms). Both grades indicate effectively zero added latency. If you see B or below, verify your shaper rates are set to ~95% of your actual line speed.

## Known Limitations

- **Only fq_codel** is supported as a queue discipline (NSS firmware limitation)
- **No traffic classification** — DSCP marking, squashing, and multi-class prioritization are not possible with NSS qdiscs. All flows get equal treatment within fq_codel's fair queuing.
- **ECN marking does not work** — Despite full source-level support from tc → kernel module ([`nss_codel.c`](https://git.codelinaro.org/clo/qsdk/oss/lklm/nss-clients/-/blob/NHSS.QSDK.12.5.0.6/nss_qdisc/nss_codel.c): `q->ecn = qopt->ecn`) → firmware interface ([`nss_shaper.h`](https://git.codelinaro.org/clo/qsdk/oss/lklm/nss-drv/-/blob/NHSS.QSDK.12.5.0.6/exports/nss_shaper.h): `nss_shaper_config_codel_param.ecn`), the NSS firmware does not perform ECN marking. The `ecn_mark` counter in `tc -s` always reads 0 even with ECN-negotiated flows and active CoDel drops. See [ECN passthrough](#4-ecn-passthrough-firmware-limitation-documented) for full test methodology.
- **peakrate (dual-rate shaping) untested** — The `nsstbl` kernel module ([`nss_tbl.c`](https://git.codelinaro.org/clo/qsdk/oss/lklm/nss-clients/-/blob/NHSS.QSDK.12.5.0.6/nss_qdisc/nss_tbl.c)) supports CIR + PIR via `lap_cir`/`lap_pir`, and tc accepts the `peakrate` keyword with the [iproute2 patch](https://github.com/qosmio/openwrt-ipq/pull/86). However, `tc -s` does not display peakrate in output, making it unclear whether the firmware actually applies dual-rate shaping.
- **No `stab` (Link Layer Adaptation)** — NSS hardware qdiscs don't support tc's statistics-based overhead accounting. The auto-detected fixed overhead is sufficient for Ethernet/FTTH; DSL with ATM framing may see minor inaccuracy for small packets.
- On kernel 5.15, the router may crash on `ip link up` of the IFB interface under high load, especially when triggered by hotplug. A workaround in the script prevents execution from hotplug events.
